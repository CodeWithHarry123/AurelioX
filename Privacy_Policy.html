  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you use our mobile application (“App”). We are committed to ensuring your privacy is protected. By using our App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect your device ID, model, operating system version, and other diagnostic data to prevent fraud (such as emulator detection or rooted device usage).</li>
    <li><strong>Ad Data:</strong> We use AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers and cookies for ad personalization and analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect data related to ad views, ad clicks, referral codes, coins earned, and withdrawal requests to provide rewards and protect against misuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Information:</strong> We check your internet status to ensure app functionality and ad availability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To detect fraudulent behavior (e.g., emulators, fake referrals, fake clicks/impressions).</li>
    <li>To reward users fairly using our coin system with daily limits and bonuses.</li>
    <li>To improve app performance and user experience.</li>
    <li>To comply with AdMob and Play Store policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Ad Services (AdMob)</h2>
  <p>We use Google AdMob to serve advertisements. AdMob may collect and use your device information and behavior data to show relevant ads. For more details, please read the <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google Ad Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>4. Reward System & Withdrawals</h2>
  <p>Our app offers virtual coins for viewing ads. These coins can be used within the app. In case of any real-money withdrawal options (e.g., Paytm/UPI), we follow local laws and platform guidelines strictly. However, we are not a gambling or betting platform.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

  <h2>6. Referral System</h2>
  <p>We allow users to refer others using a referral code. We track referrals to prevent self-referrals or abuse using fraud detection techniques.</p>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our app may use third-party services (such as Firebase, Google Play Services, AdMob) that may collect data under their own privacy policies. We recommend you review their policies as well.</p>

  <h2>8. User Control & Consent</h2>
  <p>By using our app, you consent to this privacy policy. You can choose to stop using the app at any time if you do not agree with our data handling practices.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with a new effective date.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
